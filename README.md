## Project Definition
The application, emuLadder, is a Fantasy eSports game similar to ESPNâ€™s Fantasy Football, Hockey, etc. Users draft real-life eSports players from games such as League of Legends and compete against other users with their drafted players. Users earn points based on their drafted players stats per game. Fantasy games are very popular in sports such as football, soccer, hockey and many more, however, there is not a strong presence of Fantasy eSports. eSports is an ever-growing scene, and emuLadder seeks to provide a Fantasy experience to a community that not only enjoys eSports but also to those that enjoy video games in general. To achieve this, emuLadder looks to provide a competitive environment that keeps the user involved in both their Fantasy game and the eSports games their players are competing in.
